# android-liveliness-detection
An android application which detects if the faces belong to alive humans or fake posters , using Support Vector Machines with LBP features.


The SVM model is trained via NUAA's client/imposter dataset and you need to create a libsvm folder in your external storage of your phone
and add the model there. 

This project uses OpenCV 2.4.13
The face detection is implemented via Google-Vision
